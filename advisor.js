 * A RULE / HEURISTIC engine - NOT a trained or black-box model. It reads
 * the current layout + demand config and returns a ranked list of
 * explained suggestions. Every suggestion states three things:
 *   finding   - what it observed
 *   principle - the operations-research / warehousing idea behind it
 *   impact    - an ESTIMATED effect, measured with the real simulation
 *               wherever a number is possible (else clearly qualitative)
 *
 * Deterministic: it only calls the pure sim (fixed seed from config) and
 * the deterministic optimizer, so the same inputs give the same advice.
