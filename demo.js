/* =====================================================================
 * Logistics Flow Studio - WarehouseTwin
 * demo.js - the one-click GUIDED DEMO plan + the "About / why this" copy
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Phase P8 (commercial demo polish). This module is a PURE, DETERMINISTIC
 * DESCRIPTION of the guided demo - data, not DOM. It knows the ORDER of a
 * short end-to-end tour and which existing app capability each step
 * exercises; it does NOT touch the page. app.js drives the real UI by
 * handing `run()` a controller whose `actions` map the step action names
 * to the SAME functions the manual controls already call (loadExample,
 * runWmsOps, flowPlay, the KPI cockpit repaint, the WMS Report button) -
 * so the demo never re-implements a feature, it only sequences them.
 *
 * WT.demo = { PARAMS, ACTIONS, STEPS, script, run, ABOUT }
 *   PARAMS    timing knobs (pauses) - plain numbers.
 *   ACTIONS   the KNOWN capability names a step may reference (the set
 *             verify_demo.js asserts every step.action against).
 *   STEPS     the canonical ordered step plan. Each step:
 *               { id, title, blurb, action[, exampleId, pauseAfterMs] }
 *   script()  -> a FRESH deep copy of the ordered step list (so a caller
 *             can annotate its copy without mutating the canon; two calls
 *             are byte-identical -> deterministic).
 *   run(ctrl) -> drives the plan through an injected controller and
 *             resolves to { ran:[actionNames], stopped:bool, steps:n }.
 *             Interruptible: ctrl.stopped() is checked before every step.
 *   ABOUT     the concise, HONEST positioning copy (structured data) the
 *             About panel renders - single source of truth, so the honesty
 *             statements are asserted headlessly in verify_demo.js.
 *
 * HARD HONESTY (mirrored in the UI + README): the demo loads a SYNTHETIC,
 * illustrative example scenario (no real company/brand); the About copy is
 * hype-free and states the offline / synthetic-unless-imported /
 * not-a-certification facts. No external references - fully offline.
 *
 * Classic script attaching to the global `WT` namespace so it works from
 * file:// too. No dependencies at module-load time.
