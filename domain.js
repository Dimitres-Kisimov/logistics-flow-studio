   * Storage characteristics (relative teaching values):
   *   density     = pallet positions per m^2 of the element footprint,

   *                 (This footprint is the racking itself; the aisle it
   *                 needs is a separate placed gap - see aisle rule.)
   *   selectivity = fraction of stored pallets directly accessible

   *                 extra repositioning time; flow-rack pick faces
   *                 present goods and save time.
   *   goodsToPerson + cycleSec = the system delivers the load to the
   *                 operator (AS/RS crane, shuttle): a pick line from it
   *                 adds a machine cycle time instead of walking travel.

   * SLOTTING + PICKING STRATEGIES.

   * 80% of pick lines; B: next 30%; C: last 50%). A-items are slotted

   * P3 adds PICKING strategies layered on ABC slotting:
   *   zone  - the floor splits into vertical zones, one resident picker
   *           each; an order's lines are picked in parallel per zone and
   *           consolidated (consolidation overhead per order).
   *   batch - N orders are combined into one picking tour; the tour's
   *           travel is shared, with a downstream sort overhead/order.
   *   wave  - orders are released in timed waves; within a wave, larger
   *           batches are built (more sharing) at the cost of a wave
   *           setup overhead. See DOMAIN_NOTES.md for the simplifications.
