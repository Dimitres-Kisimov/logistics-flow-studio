 * Logistics Flow Studio - WarehouseTwin
 * examples.js - the preselected Example Scenarios library + data export
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * HARD HONESTY (mirrored in the UI + README): every scenario here is a
 * REALISTIC-BUT-ILLUSTRATIVE SYNTHETIC set-up. The names describe real
 * industry segments (automotive JIT, cold-chain, pharma GDP, AS/RS
 * high-bay, ...) but NONE is a real company, brand, or a depiction of
 * any firm's actual site - there are NO real names, logos or data. The
 * operational figures in each `dataProfile` are PLAUSIBLE ESTIMATES for
 * that industry, labelled synthetic - they are NOT measured and NOT a
 * quotation. Every generated layout is checked against the SAME ASR/DIN
 * guidance as the rest of the app (compliance.js) - informed by, NOT a
 * certification.
 *
 * WT.examples = { library, build, exportData, exportCsv, ITEM_COVERAGE }
 *   library       >=20 named, distinct warehouse/plant scenarios spanning
 *                 real industries. Each entry:
 *                   { id, name, industry, description, config, dataProfile }
 *   build(id)     -> { elements, config, meta, gridW, gridH }
 *                 DETERMINISTIC layout for the example. Built by reusing
 *                 WT.generate.generateLayout (proven overlap-free +
 *                 never-failing), then geometry-preserving racking-type
 *                 substitution (keeps compliance non-fail) and a few
 *                 safe flow-element adds via applyCommand. Overlap-free
 *                 and PASSES / honestly WARNS compliance.check.
 *   exportData(id)-> a wt-1 layout object (the app's serialize() schema)
 *   exportCsv(id) -> an Excel-openable CSV string (every element row +
 *                 a KPI/summary block + the dataProfile rows)
 *   ITEM_COVERAGE the sorted set of element types used across the whole
 *                 library (a MAJORITY of the app's palette - asserted in
 *                 verify_examples.js).
 *
 * Determinism: pure functions of the pinned per-example config. No Date,
 * no Math.random - build/export twice yields byte-identical output
 * (verified in verify_examples.js).
 *
 * Classic script attaching to the global `WT` namespace so it works from
 * file:// too. Reuses domain.js, generate.js and compliance.js.

   * empty "streets", so three properties hold BY CONSTRUCTION and are
   * asserted in verify_examples.js:
   *
   *   1. OVERLAP-FREE  - every element sits on disjoint integer cells;
   *      the street grid is always empty.
   *   2. AISLE-SAFE    - the only facing storage-row gaps are 0 (racks
   *      back-to-back, not an aisle) or >= MIN_AISLE (a working aisle or
   *      a street). No gap ever lands in (0, MIN_AISLE), so the DIN 15185
   *      aisle-width check can WARN (tight) but NEVER FAIL.
   *   3. ESCAPE-SAFE   - every storage row has an empty working aisle on
   *      a side that opens onto the always-empty street grid, which runs
   *      to the dock walls; so no rack is boxed in (ASR A2.3 reachability
   *      never fails; long internal travel on a big plant honestly warns).
   *
   * NO Date, NO RNG. Deterministic column-index cycling (ci % pool.length)
   * drives the (purely cosmetic) type variation, so build()/exportData() are
   * byte-identical on every run. Every one of the 29 palette types appears.
