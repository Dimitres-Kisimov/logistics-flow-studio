const CACHE_VERSION = "wt-v37"; // v1.8: Living plant - "P" switches the whole view 2D <-> 2.5D (the SAME toggle the "2.5D view" button fires; input- + modifier-guarded keydown, Pan keeps its own button/Space/middle-drag); the animated MATERIAL FLOW now renders in the 2.5D view too (the in-flight MUs + station queues are projected through the iso projection via projPx and drawn stage-coloured, zoom/pan/Fit-safe - not just top-down); and the EQUIPMENT itself is animated in BOTH views (conveyor belts scroll unit-loads, RGV/AGV vehicles travel their lane, AS/RS + shuttle carriages run the aisle and lift) via a DETERMINISTIC animation phase seeded from the flow sim's tick (WT.shapes.equipmentPhase - NO Date/Math.random; one source of truth passed into WT.shapes.draw2D/draw3D so 2D + 3D move identically), which PAUSES when the sim is paused (static frame), is LOD-aware (skipped when tiny), honours reduced-motion, and leaves the static form byte-identical when the flow is not running. Illustrative animation of a synthetic model - labels/data unaffected, no real brands, offline/no deps. New verify_animation.js harness (31st) + a live "P"-toggles-the-view self-test check. Previously wt-v36 (v1.7): Deep-link to a scenario via URL - a new PURE, DOM-free parser (deeplink.js -> WT.deeplink.parse) lets a URL open a specific example scenario and skip onboarding, so a plant is shareable/embeddable with a link (index.html?scenario=coldchain-frozen-dc) and demos/screenshots can open a chosen plant directly. On boot, ?scenario=<id> / ?example=<id> loads that library scenario onto the floor via the SAME loadExample() the UI uses (the app validates the id against WT.examples.library; an unknown id falls through to a normal boot with a gentle toast), ?onboarding=0 suppresses the welcome modal on its own, and a ?scenario= implies onboarding suppression - for THAT load only, never flipping the saved "don't show again" flag. Composes with ?selftest=1 and the existing #layout= share-hash (precedence: share-hash wins, else scenario, else saved, else demo). Nothing new is persisted; fully offline. New verify_deeplink.js harness (30th) + a live ?scenario= self-test check. Previously wt-v35 (v1.6): Production hardening pass 2 - ACCESSIBILITY (aria-labelled main regions + toolbar controls; the #floor canvas gains an aria-label + an aria-describedby offscreen summary kept current by app.js; a visible :focus-visible outline; prefers-reduced-motion honoured so the material-flow animation never auto-runs - Play shows a static/stepped frame, app stays fully usable) and PERFORMANCE for large layouts (the pure WT.view.cullToView culls the per-frame element draw to the visible world rectangle; shapes LOD unchanged; simulation results unchanged - rendering only). New docs/QA_CHECKLIST.md + a PRODUCTION.md section; selftest.js extended with a11y/perf checks; new verify_a11y_perf.js harness (29th). A11y is real but NOT a WCAG certification; perf is bounded-effort. Previously wt-v34 (v1.5): Production hardening - global error boundary (errors.js), in-browser E2E self-test (selftest.js, ?selftest=1), and a strict offline Content-Security-Policy meta in index.html. errors.js loads first (before all app scripts) and records uncaught errors/rejections into window.__WT_ERRORS__ + surfaces a non-blocking honest banner; selftest.js is INERT without the flag and, when enabled, drives the LIVE app through the same handlers the UI uses (exposed as window.__WT_TEST_API__ in self-test mode) writing a machine-readable `WT-SELFTEST: PASS n/n` into #wt-selftest. New verify_hardening.js harness (28th). Previously wt-v33: Distinct 2D + 3D object representations (shapes.js -> WT.shapes, the SINGLE per-type shape registry: has/draw2D/draw3D/ICONS/meta). Every warehouse object type now has a distinct, recognizable top-down GLYPH (shelf-bay grids, depth/flow chevrons, cantilever arms, AS/RS crane-aisle hatch, shuttle channels, mezzanine platform, dock notches, conveyor rollers, station benches, RGV/AGV vehicles, block-stack pattern) AND a distinct ISOMETRIC form (open see-through rack frames, tall crane tower, raised deck on legs, low belt bed, bench furniture, floor vehicles, stacked cubes) - reused by BOTH renderers (app.js draw2D + iso.js draw3D route through WT.shapes, fallback-safe to the old rect/box). LOD path keeps large layouts fast + legible at any zoom; iso forms reuse the domain heightM (single source of truth with the IFC export). Illustrative schematic, NOT CAD/BIM. New verify_shapes.js harness (shapes/app/iso/index/sw changed)
